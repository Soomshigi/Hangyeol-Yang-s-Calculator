# Hangyeol-Yang-s-Calculator
ICS4U-SA Project

-Plan-
1. Working on a scientific calculator without using Tkinter. (From 2024-05-11 -> 2024-05-12)
- Functions for addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, square root, cube root, power of 2-3, factorial, power of y, trigonometric, logarithmic, constant, finding roots.
- Shift feature
- Function for calculation
- Working on BODMAS
2. Finishing a Scientific calculator with Tkinter. (Before 2024-05-12)


-Instruction-[PLEASE READ]
1. You must not summarize the steps of writing expression. ex) 2(4+9) x => 2*(4+9) O, cos(0  x => cos(0) O,[if possible] -3 + 2 x => (-3)+2
2. This calculator has no button for [] or {}, so you can only use a bracket around an expression once (cannot have a bracket inside a bracket)
3. To write log_b(y), you must put a bracket around for the base and result. ex)log_2(4) = log(2)(4)
4. This calculator is in radian (there wasn't any mention of radian and degree, so I did not add anything for it)
5. If it is impossible to solve a given expression, the answer will not show
6. if there is not root for cubic equations(all complex number), the answer will not show too
7. When you press the eqn button, press Q or C to find zeros for the quadratic and cubic equations. Please follow the format shown properly, or it might cause an error.
8. All the zeros can be expressed up to 3 digits, whereas all the answers for expression can be expressed up to 5 digit
9. AGAIN PLEASE!!! FOLLOW THE PROPER AND FULL ORDER OF WRITING THE EXPRESSION!!!!
